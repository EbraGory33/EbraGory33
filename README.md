## 👋 About Me  

With a desire to understand how **systems work beneath the surface** — not just how interfaces look, but how **data flows**, how **services communicate**, and how **architecture decisions impact performance** — I was drawn to software engineering. That curiosity pushed me to move beyond simply using technology and toward building it, solving problems through **thoughtful design**, **clean code**, and **well-structured systems**.

I’m a **Software Engineer** with hands-on experience developing applications using **React**, **Node.js**, **Java**, and **Python**. I enjoy designing **clean APIs**, modeling data with **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**, integrating third-party services, and containerizing applications with **Docker**. What excites me most is seeing how each layer — **client**, **API**, **server**, and **database** — works together to create **scalable**, **reliable**, and **maintainable software**.

I value writing **structured, readable code** and making thoughtful **system design decisions**, including **data modeling**, **normalization**, and **performance optimization**. I adapt quickly to new tools and frameworks, and I approach technical challenges with **curiosity**, **persistence**, and a focus on **long-term maintainability**.

Currently, I’m focused on deepening my understanding of **backend architecture**, **distributed systems fundamentals**, and **scalable cloud-based application development**.
